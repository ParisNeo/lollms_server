  WARNING: This personality generates shell commands based on your input.
  Executing code generated by language models can be EXTREMELY DANGEROUS.
  The 'execution' in this example is SIMULATED and does NOT run commands on your actual system.
  Do NOT modify this script to perform real execution unless you fully understand the security risks.
