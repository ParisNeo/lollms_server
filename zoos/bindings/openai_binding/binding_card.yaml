  Binding for OpenAI's official API and other OpenAI-compatible API endpoints (like Groq, Together.ai, Mistral API, Azure OpenAI, local servers like vLLM with OpenAI endpoint). Supports text and vision models (GPT-4o, GPT-4 Vision, etc.).

  - openai>=1.0.0
  - pillow>=9.0.0 # Needed for image processing if vision models are used
